DOI: 10.1161/STR.0000000000000407 therefore be considered in the decision-making process. The recommendation is to initiate antiepileptic medication in the context of an electrographic seizure that is clinically suspected to be contributing to the impaired consciousness in order to improve morbidity (defined as LOS >14 days or discharge to somewhere other than home or a rehabilitation facility). 325 Identifying electrographic seizures can be challenging, however, and may require consultation. 2. There are no large, prospective RCTs to demonstrate the efficacy of treating seizures in the context of ICH. One small randomized trial evaluated the use of prophylactic valproic acid and suggested no difference in mortality or long-term seizure control.336 Other studies similarly failed to demonstrate a clear mortality benefit from treating seizures in the context of ICH.337339 Still others showed better outcomes in patients with post-ICH seizures. 333,334 However, given the inherent limitations in the design of the available studies and the low risk of antiseizure medications in the context of active seizures, the benefits for both abortive and preventive treatment of seizures appear likely to outweigh the risks. Risk scores such as the CAVE score 340 can be used to estimate the risk of late seizures ( >7 days after ICH). However, in the absence of evidence that antiepileptic medications prevent late seizures after ICH, risk scores should not be used to guide continuation of antiepileptic drugs. 3. The primary focus is on those with possible seizures that are likely contributing to the clinical picture such as patients with ICH with impaired or fluctuating level of consciousness out of proportion to the degree of brain injury or other metabolic abnormalities. These patients may not demonstrate clear and convincing rhythmic movements consistent with typical clinical seizures. If seizures are clinically suspected in this context, it is reasonable to evaluate them with a continuous electroencephalogram for at least 24 hours. One study noted that 28% of those with electrographic seizures were detected after at least 24 hours of continuous monitoring, whereas 94% were detected with at least 48 hours of monitoring. Among patients in a coma, 36% required continuous electroencephalography monitoring for >24 hours to detect the first seizure.327 4. Earlier studies suggested that prophylactic antiseizure drugs such as phenytoin were associated with worse outcomes in patients with ICH. 335,341 Consequently, the use of alternative prophylactic antiseizure drugs such as levetiracetam may have become more common. 342 Recent studies have not consistently identified harm or benefit from the use of prophylactic antiseizure drugs after spontaneous ICH with respect to global functional outcomes,328331,343 but specific domains of abilities such as cognitive function might be negatively affected.344 One meta-analysis (1 RCT, 7 observational studies) found that seizure prophylaxis in patients with ICH was not associated with preventing either early ( <14 days from ICH) or long-term seizures.345 Another meta-analysis reported that neither levetiracetam nor phenytoin prophylaxis was associated with worse functional outcomes at the longest follow-up or 90 days, although there was a trend toward better outcomes in populations with higher proportions of patients taking levetiracetam.346 Knowledge Gaps and Future Research The relationship between seizures and outcomes and the impact of antiseizure medications, especially when given in a targeted and time-limited manner, on outcome in patients with ICH are not well defined. The optimal approach to the patient with ICH with impaired consciousness and an abnormal electroencephalogram is not well defined. There is no clear consensus on which abnormal electrographic patterns in patients with ICH and impaired consciousness, with or without seizure, have prognostic significance. 5.5.

Assessment and Plan:
Suspected Diagnosis: {diagnosis}
After ensuring that there were no evident contraindications, TNK administration was recommended at {tnkAdminTime}. Potential benefits, potential risks (including a potential risk of sx ICH of up to 4%), and alternatives to treatment were discussed with the patient, family/LNOK, and OSH provider.
TNK was administered at {tnkAdminTime} after a brief time-out.

Continue monitoring.",ref:"AHA/ASA 2019 Acute Ischemic Stroke Guidelines"},{q:"Patient has ICH Score of 4. Family wants to know prognosis. Should we recommend comfort care?",a:"No. The ICH Score predicts 30-day MORTALITY, not functional outcome, and was derived from cohorts with high rates of early DNR/withdrawal. AHA recommends postponing DNR at least 24h (Class IIa). Use FUNC Score for functional prognosis and provide aggressive care for at least 72 hours before prognosticating.",ref:"AHA/ASA ICH 2022; Hemphill 2001; Rost 2008"},{q:"Patient has cerebral venous thrombosis with hemorrhagic venous infarction. Should I hold anticoagulation?",a:"No. Anticoagulate even with hemorrhage. CVT-associated hemorrhage is caused by venous congestion, and anticoagulation treats the underlying cause. AHA/ASA recommends initial anticoagulation with heparin even in presence of ICH (Class IIa, LOE B).",ref:"AHA/ASA CVT 2024; ESO 2017"},{q:"Patient has NIHSS 3 but CTA shows M1 occlusion. Do they need EVT?",a:"Likely yes. Low NIHSS does not exclude LVO benefit. MR CLEAN-LATE and ESCAPE showed benefit even with lower NIHSS in LVO. Early neurological deterioration occurs in up to 30% of untreated LVO patients with initially low NIHSS. Discuss with neurointerventionalist.",ref:"AHA/ASA 2026; MR CLEAN-LATE 2023"},{q:"Patient had a seizure at stroke onset. Is TNK contraindicated?",a:"No. Seizure at onset is no longer an absolute contraindication if residual deficits are clearly attributable to stroke (not postictal). If doubt exists, CT/CTA can help. The key concern is misdiagnosing Todd paralysis as stroke \u2014 do a thorough exam.",ref:"AHA/ASA 2019; ACT-FAST 2022"},{q:"Should I start prophylactic anti-seizure medication in this ICH patient?",a:"No. Routine prophylactic AEDs are NOT recommended for ICH (Class III: No Benefit).

Is this a concern?",a:"Yes. Omeprazole and esomeprazole are strong CYP2C19 inhibitors that significantly reduce clopidogrel active metabolite.

This interaction does NOT apply to DOACs or aspirin.",ref:"FDA Safety Communication 2009; COGENT trial 2010"},{q:"Patient had TNK 3 hours ago, now new hemianopia.
