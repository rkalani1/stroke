## Review Notes
- Promotion requires methodological quality check before updating recommendation logic.
- For accepted items, update: `docs/evidence-review-2021-2026.md`, relevant pathway UI text, and generated-note traces.
- Re-run `npm run validate:citations` and `npm run qa` after any evidence promotion edits.
