## Notes
- This watchlist is a screening aid, not an automatic recommendation update.
- Priority scores are triage-only and weight guideline/trial signal, recency, source strength, and direct workflow relevance.
- Additions to evidence tables should still be clinician-reviewed for methodological quality and workflow relevance.
- Filtered low-actionability entries are listed below for optional reviewer override.
