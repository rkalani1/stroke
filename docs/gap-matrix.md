# Gap Matrix

| Clinical domain | Current site coverage | Evidence update (2021-2026) | Gap | Proposed fix | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AIS thrombolysis (TNK vs alteplase) | TNK and contraindication content present; pathway logic exists. | AcT, TRACE-2, ORIGINAL and ESO TNK recommendation strengthen TNK 0.25 mg/kg role. | Dosing/selection language needs explicit harmonized TNK-first rule with alteplase fallback conditions. | Add concise TNK-first decision card with inclusion/exclusion and fallback branch in Encounter Decision section. | P0 |
| Wake-up/unknown onset AIS | Wake-up workflow and unknown LKW fields exist. | TWIST mixed/negative broad effect in non-advanced imaging contexts; imaging-guided selection remains key. | Risk of over-broad thrombolysis interpretation if imaging requirements are not explicit. | Add hard-stop reminder for imaging-based selection in wake-up/unknown onset pathway copy. | P0 |
| EVT large core | EVT recommendation and LVO fields present. | SELECT2, ANGEL-ASPECT, RESCUE-Japan LIMIT, TENSION support EVT benefit in selected large-core patients. | Large-core eligibility messaging may still look restrictive/legacy in parts of UI. | Added large-core evidence highlight and explicit “do not exclude solely for large core” note in ischemic management. | P0 (completed iter-004) |
| ICH hyperacute bundle | ICH pathway and reversal fields present. | 2022 AHA ICH guideline + INTERACT3 bundle evidence + ANNEXA-I + ENRICH surgical data. | Bundle execution steps are spread across sections and can be missed under pressure. | Added one-screen ICH first-hour critical bundle card (BP, reversal, ICU escalation, early surgery screen). | P0 (completed iter-004) |
| SAH pathway | SAH sections and grading tools present. | 2023 AHA SAH guideline reinforces early securement + DCI prevention workflows. | High-value SAH first-hour actions not consolidated in single rapid card. | Add SAH rapid checklist card at top of SAH tab (securement, BP target context, nimodipine, DCI watch). | P1 |
| CVT pathway | CVT section exists. | 2024 AHA CVT statement + ACTION-CVT observational evidence for DOAC transition in selected patients. | CVT anticoag and escalation sequence could be more explicit. | Add CVT treatment timeline strip (initial anticoag, ICP red flags, transition options). | P1 |
| Secondary prevention DAPT | Prevention content present. | CHANCE-2, INSPIRES refine phenotype-specific DAPT selection and duration. | DAPT duration guidance may be diffuse across notes/checklists. | Add compact DAPT matrix by phenotype/timing (minor stroke/high-risk TIA/LAA context). | P0 |
| AF-related anticoag timing | AF, CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED support present. | ELAN and TIMING support earlier DOAC in selected patients. | App lacks explicit early-vs-delayed anticoag timing card tied to infarct size/hemorrhage risk. | Add anticoag timing quick card in prevention section with caution flags. | P1 |
| Pregnancy/peripartum stroke | Limited explicit pregnancy-focused operational guidance. | Maternal stroke focused update emphasizes urgent, coordinated stroke care. | Special-population workflow not surfaced enough in acute view. | Add special population panel with pregnancy/peripartum emergency notes and maternal-fetal coordination triggers. | P1 |
| Renal dysfunction and anticoag dosing | Creatinine and CrCl fields exist. | Recent guidance emphasizes dose-pathway safety for anticoagulation and imaging contrast decisions. | Decision-support prompts for renal dosing/contrast precautions are not prominent. | Add renal-safety prompt chips where anticoag/contrast decisions are made. | P1 |
| Senior-first cognitive load | Fast tools exist (search, shortcuts, calculators), but pathway auto-routing can interrupt utility workflows. | Implementation data favor protocolized, low-friction workflows. | Diagnosis updates can pull users away from active utility tabs. | Keep diagnosis-aware routing but preserve user intent when in Calculators/References. | P1 (completed iter-001) |
| QA/Regression discipline | Build pipeline exists, no automated tests, compare-keys script exists. | High-acuity clinical apps need strict non-regression controls. | No standardized regression checklist in repo. | Add `docs/regression-checklist.md` and run per release. | P0 |
