# Gap Matrix

| Clinical domain | Current site coverage | Evidence update (2021-2026) | Gap | Proposed fix | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AIS thrombolysis (TNK vs alteplase) | TNK and contraindication content present; pathway logic exists. | AcT, TRACE-2, ORIGINAL and ESO TNK recommendation strengthen TNK 0.25 mg/kg role. | Dosing/selection language needs explicit harmonized TNK-first rule with alteplase fallback conditions. | Added TNK-first decision card with dosing, alteplase fallback conditions, and key exclusions before TNK checkbox. | P0 (completed iter-007) |
| Wake-up/unknown onset AIS | Wake-up workflow and unknown LKW fields exist. | TWIST mixed/negative broad effect in non-advanced imaging contexts; imaging-guided selection remains key. | Risk of over-broad thrombolysis interpretation if imaging requirements are not explicit. | Added imaging hard-stop alert at top of wake-up panel requiring DWI-FLAIR or CTP mismatch before thrombolysis. | P0 (completed iter-007) |
| EVT large core | EVT recommendation and LVO fields present. | SELECT2, ANGEL-ASPECT, RESCUE-Japan LIMIT, TENSION support EVT benefit in selected large-core patients. | Large-core eligibility messaging may still look restrictive/legacy in parts of UI. | Added large-core evidence highlight and explicit “do not exclude solely for large core” note in ischemic management. | P0 (completed iter-004) |
| ICH hyperacute bundle | ICH pathway and reversal fields present. | 2022 AHA ICH guideline + INTERACT3 bundle evidence + ANNEXA-I + ENRICH surgical data. | Bundle execution steps are spread across sections and can be missed under pressure. | Added one-screen ICH first-hour critical bundle card (BP, reversal, ICU escalation, early surgery screen). | P0 (completed iter-004) |
| SAH pathway | SAH sections and grading tools present. | 2023 AHA SAH guideline reinforces early securement + DCI prevention workflows. | High-value SAH first-hour actions not consolidated in single rapid card. | Added SAH first-hour rapid actions card (airway/ICU, BP, securing, nimodipine, hydrocephalus, DCI surveillance). | P1 (completed iter-006) |
| CVT pathway | CVT section exists. | 2024 AHA CVT statement + ACTION-CVT observational evidence for DOAC transition in selected patients. | CVT anticoag and escalation sequence could be more explicit. | Added CVT treatment timeline strip (acute/subacute/duration/escalation) with ACTION-CVT DOAC data. | P1 (completed iter-006) |
| Secondary prevention DAPT | Prevention content present. | CHANCE-2, INSPIRES refine phenotype-specific DAPT selection and duration. | DAPT duration guidance may be diffuse across notes/checklists. | Add compact DAPT matrix by phenotype/timing (minor stroke/high-risk TIA/LAA context). | P0 |
| AF-related anticoag timing | AF, CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED support present. | ELAN and TIMING support earlier DOAC in selected patients. | App lacks explicit early-vs-delayed anticoag timing card tied to infarct size/hemorrhage risk. | Added AF anticoag timing quick card in prevention section (CATALYST/ELAN/TIMING grid + caution flags). | P1 (completed iter-006) |
| Pregnancy/peripartum stroke | Limited explicit pregnancy-focused operational guidance. | Maternal stroke focused update emphasizes urgent, coordinated stroke care. | Special-population workflow not surfaced enough in acute view. | Enhanced pregnancy panel with 4-cell rapid actions grid (treatment, coordination, differential, medication safety). | P1 (completed iter-007) |
| Renal dysfunction and anticoag dosing | Creatinine and CrCl fields exist. | Recent guidance emphasizes dose-pathway safety for anticoagulation and imaging contrast decisions. | Decision-support prompts for renal dosing/contrast precautions are not prominent. | Added renal-safety auto-alert in contrast section (CrCl-based) + existing DOAC dose checker already covers anticoag. | P1 (completed iter-008) |
| Senior-first cognitive load | Fast tools exist (search, shortcuts, calculators), but pathway auto-routing can interrupt utility workflows. | Implementation data favor protocolized, low-friction workflows. | Diagnosis updates can pull users away from active utility tabs. | Keep diagnosis-aware routing but preserve user intent when in Calculators/References. | P1 (completed iter-001) |
| QA/Regression discipline | Build pipeline exists, no automated tests, compare-keys script exists. | High-acuity clinical apps need strict non-regression controls. | No standardized regression checklist in repo. | Add `docs/regression-checklist.md` and run per release. | P0 |
